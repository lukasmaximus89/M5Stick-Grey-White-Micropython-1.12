# M5Stick-Grey-White-Micropython-1.12
Necessary micropython modules for interfacing with the M5Stick Grey original monochrome OLED version 

Although the original M5Stick which featured a monochrome OLED screen and came in grey or white
has now been phased out, and UiFlow support was dropped from ver 1.2.3 onwards. 
A new breath of life can be breathed into this great little device by flashing it with the latest micropython
firmware and a few essential modules to control its various hardware features.

Download the repository and use a tool such as ampy, upyloader or mu to copy the files to the flash
